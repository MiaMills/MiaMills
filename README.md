- 👋 Hi, I’m @MiaMills
- 👀 I’m interested in the fundamentals of learning the fundamentals of Java and developing competency in adapting to contexts in the wider world which may interest
  me such as education, music, literature, and any other discoveries along my coding expereince.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git, Github, VS code, how to navigate in the CBF Entry into Tech Bootcamp for the next 3 months.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which beginners may find invaluable during their inital stages of learning a new coding language. I'm also looking   to
      understand how the transition can be made into merging the knowledge of Java with solving problems in areas which interest me or may be life
      changing for those in my community.
